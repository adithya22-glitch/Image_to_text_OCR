# Image_to_text(OCR)
This tool was created to solve a recurring problem: extracting text from images without relying on online tools. It provides a seamless local solution that works offline, without needing browser-based services. The project is inspired by but distinct from the unoptimized reference implementation at github.com/zstrathe/tesseract_portable_windows.
